      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C) and grease a baking pan.</li>
        <li>
          In a saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Remove from heat and
          stir in the sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a separate bowl, sift together the cocoa powder, flour, and salt.
          Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just
          combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and bake for 25-30
          minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a
          few moist crumbs.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the brownies are baking, prepare the chocolate ganache by
          heating the cream until it simmers, then pour it over the chopped
          chocolate. Stir until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the brownies have cooled, spread the chocolate ganache over the
          top.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cut the brownies into triangles and decorate each triangle with
          pretzels as antlers, red candy noses, and candy eyes to create
          adorable reindeer faces.
