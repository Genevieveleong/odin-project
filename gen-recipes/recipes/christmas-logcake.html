      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C) and line a baking sheet with
          parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder,
          baking soda, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          In another bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until light and fluffy. Add
          the oil, sour cream, and vanilla extract, and mix well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until
          just combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spread the batter evenly onto the prepared baking sheet and bake for
          12-15 minutes or until the cake springs back when touched.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the cake is baking, prepare the chocolate ganache by heating the
          cream until it simmers, then pour it over the chopped chocolate. Stir
          until smooth and let it cool slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the cake has cooled, spread the chocolate ganache evenly over the
          surface and roll the cake into a log shape.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decorate the log cake with chocolate shavings, powdered sugar, and
          festive decorations.
